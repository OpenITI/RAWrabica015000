# النصرانية - الأصل والواقع christianity the original and the present
~~reality النصرانية - الأصل والواقع christianity the original and the
~~present reality د/ محمد بن عبد الله السحيم dr. muhammad bin abdullah as-
~~saheem translation and footnotes abdul-qaadir abdul-khaaliq published by
~~darussalam publishers and distributors riyadh, saudi arabia بسم الله
~~الرحمن الرحيم contents publishers note …6 introduction …7 the origin of
~~christianity…9 christ, the messiah — son of allâh…12 christ — the second
~~element of the holy trinity…14 the divine as one with humanity…17 allâh
~~is a holy trinity…18 the crucifixion…20 christ died on the cross…24 the
~~lord’s supper (the eucharist)…26 bibliography and references of books of
~~some christians who accepted islam.…31 publishers note all the praise is
~~due to allâh, who has guided us to his straight path. we seek his
~~forgiveness and we seek refuge in him from the evil of our own selves
~~and our bad deeds. ‘christianity – the original and the present reality’
~~is a brief treatise in which the author has attempted to open the
~~christians’ eyes to the true reality of their erroneous beliefs and to
~~guide them to the truth. all the messengers of allâh had tried their
~~best, to convey the correct creed to their peoples. prophet ‘isa, or
~~jesus, was also among those upright messengers who strove hard to guide
~~his people to the truth, but most of them followed their whims and
~~desires and thus went astray. PageV01P0001
# believing in the oneness of allâh is a basic fundamental in islam.
~~this belief establishes the relationship between human beings and their
~~rubb (lord). as muslims we firmly believe that allâh is our creator,
~~sustainer and the true god; only he has the right to be worshipped.
~~there is no partner with him. he has the free hand in the disposal of
~~all affairs. i am thankful to br. muhammad bin ‘abdullah as-saheem who
~~has written this booklet in the arabic language and given us permission
~~to translate it into english. i pray to allâh to render this booklet
~~beneficial and be a source of guidance and blessing in both this world
~~and the hereafter. i also appreciate darussalam’s staff, who spared no
~~effort to complete this work in a very good manner. abdul malik mujahid
~~general manager introduction all praise and thanks are due to allâh, who
~~has not taken any creature as a son, nor does he have any partner in his
~~dominion, nor has he any protector from among the lowly creatures. his
~~greatness is greater than all else. i bear witness that there is nothing
~~worthy of worship in truth besides allâh alone who is singular and
~~without partner, and i bear witness that muhammad ? is his slave,
~~servant and messenger. PageV01P0002
# this is a very brief summary in which i intend to clarify the origin
~~of christianity (nasraaniyah) and its current reality. it is principally
~~intended for a christian in order that he may be aware of the roots of
~~his belief. he will perhaps come to understand how christianity has
~~undergone change and substitution to the point that it has evolved into
~~a man-made composition – this, after having once been a divine message.
~~i have made it a point to bring forth, within this summary, those
~~evidences that brought forth the truth of the matter from actual texts
~~of the torah (tawrah) and the injeel. this was done to illustrate, to
~~every christian reader, my intention to point out the truth and to guide
~~towards that which is correct. thus i write, seeking allâh’s help. the
~~origin of christianity the origin of christianity is like that of other
~~divine revelations such as the messages of noah (nuh), abraham (ibrahim)
~~and moses (musa) عليهم السلام. every divinely revealed message is
~~unanimous in its fundamental religious creed such as: belief in allâh as
~~singular and alone and without any associate; belief that he was neither
~~born nor does he give birth, belief in angels and the day of judgement
~~in the hereafter; belief in divine predestination, and the good and bad
~~of it; belief in the messengers and prophets. PageV01P0003
# there is nothing in recorded history, since the time of adam عليه
~~السلام up through the last of the prophets, muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم,
~~indicating that any known divine revelation differs in these beliefs.
~~indeed, the differences found among them are connected to the forms of
~~worship and their various conditions or appearance. also, those things
~~that were forbidden or permitted differed for various reasons as
~~legislated by allâh to the prophets, each of whom was ordered to explain
~~and clarify the law to the respective peoples. therefore, [original]
~~christianity can be termed as a divine message that calls for belief in
~~allâh as singular and without associate, and that he is neither born nor
~~does he have offspring. it confirms that allâh indeed sends messengers
~~and prophets from among men whom he has chosen from the best of people.
~~this, in order that no one can have any argument before allâh after
~~having thus been sent a messenger. the question that one is obliged to
~~ask is: has christianity remained in the state in which it was
~~originally revealed by allâh to his servant and messenger jesus (‘iesa
~~عليه السلام)? PageV01P0004
# in order to answer this question, it is necessary to bring out for our
~~mutual benefit, the reality of christianity today and compare it with
~~what has been transmitted in both the torah and the gospels attributed
~~to moses and jesus عليهم السلام respectively. this is in order to
~~examine: is the present state of christianity in accord with the
~~original message or does it differ? do the texts attributed to these
~~prophets support the beliefs that the current christian nation stands
~~upon? does what is related in these books about the life of jesus عليه
~~السلام correspond to the image introduced in the churches of today as to
~~the personality and character of the messiah? – a personality which has
~~become mythical in its proportions to the point that it can hardly be
~~accepted by the mind or proven to be real. such beliefs are followed in
~~the next pages. 1. christ, the messiah — son of allâh ‘the belief of the
~~christians that the messiah is the son of god (allâh).’ this is a belief
~~that is not supported by any statement of the messiah عليه السلام. in
~~fact, we find the torah and the gospels filled with evidence, to the
~~contrary, that nullifies this belief. we find in the gospel of john
~~19:6-8: “when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried
~~out, ‘crucify him, crucify him!’ pilate said to them, ‘take him
~~yourselves and crucify him, for i find no crime in him.’ the jews
~~answered him, ‘we have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because
~~he has made himself the son of god.’” PageV01P0005
# matthew begins his gospel c: 1:1, with what is said to be jesus’s
~~family lineage where he (matthew) states: “the book of the lineage of
~~christ, the son of david, the son of abraham.” in this lineage is an
~~evidence of his being a flesh and blood mortal in contradiction to the
~~claim of his being divine. it is as if you were to say to me, “it has
~~been attributed to jesus the description ‘son of god,’ so he therefore
~~claimed to be the son of god.” i respond thus: this description related
~~in the torah and the injeel6 is given not only to other prophets but to
~~nations and peoples. it is not something peculiar to the messiah. to be
~~sure you can look for example in exodus 4:22, psalms 2:7, chronicles
~~22:9-10, matthew 5:9, luke 3:38, and john 1:12. in all of these verses
~~are descriptions of the aforementioned groups as “sons of god,”
~~nevertheless they were not elevated to the level that you have given to
~~the messiah عليه السلام. in the gospel of john 1:12, we are given a
~~definition of what is meant by the “son of god.” it shows that it means
~~‘a believer in allâh’ as in the passage – “he came to his own home, and
~~his own people received him not. but to all who received him, who
~~believed in his name, he gave power to become children of god who were
~~born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man,
~~but of god.” 2. christ: the second element of the holy trinity ‘…the
~~belief of the christians that jesus عليه السلام, is a god along with
~~allâh, but he is the second element of the holy trinity.’ PageV01P0006
# if we examine the new testament in order to find the basis upon which
~~this belief is founded, we do not find any statement that can be
~~attributed to the messiah عليه السلام, where he makes any such claim. we
~~are, on the contrary, surprised to find that the new testament contains
~~what actually amounts to a rejection of this belief. it proclaims
~~unambiguously and with utmost clarity that there is no god other than
~~allâh and that the messiah عليه السلام is but a messenger of allâh sent
~~to the children of israel (the jews) confirming what was contained in
~~the torah and the revelation (al-injeel) sent through him. here are some
~~of the texts that support what i have just stated: a. …jesus عليه السلام
~~states in the gospel of barnabas 94:1: “and having said this, jesus said
~~again: ‘i confess before heaven, and call to witness everything that
~~dwelleth upon the earth, that i am a stranger to all that men have said
~~of me, to wit, that i am more than a man. for i am a man, born of a
~~woman, subject to the judgement of god; that live here like as other
~~men, subject to common miseries.’” b. luke and cleophus testify to the
~~humanity and mortality of the messiah when they state: “then one of
~~them, named cle‘opus, answered him, ‘are you the only visitor to
~~jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these
~~days?’ and he said to them, ‘what things?’ and they said to him,
~~‘concerning jesus of nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in deed and
~~word before god and all the people,” luke 24:18,19. look also at luke
~~7:17, and at acts of the apostles 2:22. PageV01P0007
# c. there is the statement of the messiah عليه السلام :“and this is
~~eternal life, that they know thee the only true god, and jesus christ
~~whom thou hast sent.” john 17:3. you can see that christ عليه السلام ,
~~in the first text, bears witness before the heavens and calls to witness
~~all that lives on the earth that he is absolved of those attributes
~~which elevate him above his mortal status. what can this be other than
~~that he was no more than a human being? in the second text, two of his
~~contemporaries testify that he was but an honest man of god in word and
~~deed. while in the third text is a resounding declaration of the
~~greatest truth in this universe which accords everlasting happiness to
~~the one who declares it. namely, the acknowledgement that allâh is the
~~only true god and anything falsely worshipped otherwise is utterly
~~spurious and false. it is an affirmation that christ was the messenger
~~of allâh. 3. the divine as one with humanity ‘…the belief that the
~~divine has mixed with the human.’ if we take a close look at the
~~teachings of christ عليه السلام, we would see that he never directs
~~anyone to this. on the contrary, we witness his teaching to have belief
~~in monotheism (tawheed) pure from any of the stains of polytheism
~~(shirk). a very clear proof are the words of christ related in mark
~~12:29: “listen, o children of israel, the lord god is but a single
~~lord.” PageV01P0008
# may be your perusal of the evidences i have referred to in the
~~previous passages, along with the one i have just shown, will show you
~~whether those evidences taken from the christians book support this
~~belief or do they conflict with it and nullify it? 4. allâh is a holy
~~trinity ‘…the belief that allâh is an element of the tripartite commonly
~~known as “the holy trinity.’” this is a belief held by christianity
~~alone among all divine religions. is it truly supported by the holy book
~~or does it refute such a belief? one, who honestly gives thought to what
~~is purported from christ عليه السلام, will find that the basis of the
~~message of jesus is a call to tawheed and a negation of attributing to
~~allâh the similitudes with his creation. it is stripping away divine
~~qualities from all else except allâh and an affirmation that worship
~~belongs to allâh alone. look again closely at the evidence cited in the
~~second and third passages and you will not find any ambiguity or
~~vagueness therein. this is from one point of view. a second is that
~~christendom has fabricated its claim that allâh is the third of a co-
~~equal trinity: the father being a god; the son a second; and the holy
~~spirit a third. this is incorrect. they believe that the holy spirit
~~emanates from the father and the son. it is not possible that each
~~element could be equal and without a beginning if the third proceeded
~~from the two before it! as well, each single element has its own
~~peculiar characteristics which cannot be attributed to the other. also,
~~the father is always at the top of the scheme, with the son after, and
~~the PageV01P0009
# holy spirit as the third in order. you would never accept that the
~~holy spirit be placed at the fore, with the son to follow, and the
~~father as the third. indeed you would consider this as disbelief and
~~apostasy. so how then can they be at all equal! looking from even
~~another angle, to even term the spirit alone as “holy” points to a lack
~~of equality. 5. the crucifixion ‘…the belief of the christians that
~~christ was crucified by the jews at the order of pontius pilate and that
~~he died on the cross.’ the holy book itself provides the refutation of
~~this belief. for in the old testament the one crucified is deemed
~~accursed as is shown is deuteronomy (22:23). “and if a man has committed
~~a crime punishable by death and he is put to death, and you hang him on
~~a tree, his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but you shall
~~bury him the same day, for a hanged man is accursed by god; you shall
~~not defile your land which the lord your god gives you for an
~~inheritance.” think about it! how can the god of the christians be
~~cursed by their very own book? PageV01P0010
# as in the gospel of luke 4:29,30 where allâh safeguarded and protected
~~the messiah عليه السلام from the deception of the jews and their
~~plotting so that they were unable to crucify him: “and they rose up and
~~put him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which
~~their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong. but
~~passing through the midst of them he went away.” and it says in john
~~8:59: “so they took up stones to throw at him; but jesus hid himself,
~~and went out of the temple.” also in john 10:39: “again they tried to
~~arrest him, but he escaped from their hands.” these texts – and there
~~are many like them – confirm that allâh protected christ عليه السلام
~~from the conspiracy of the jews and their plotting. indeed, there are
~~texts which confirm that the jews were not even sure of christ’s
~~identity to the extent that they had to hire someone to point him out to
~~them. (see matthew 27:3,4 ) likewise, christ عليه السلام said that the
~~disciples would be stricken with doubt on the night of his being
~~betrayed, for he stated: “and jesus said to them, ‘you will all fall
~~away; for it is written: i will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will
~~be scattered.’” (mark 14:27) PageV01P0011
# then what indeed was the end of christ عليه السلام upon this earth?
~~allâh raised him unto himself, and this is written in your book: “and
~~when he said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a
~~cloud took him out of their sight. and while they were gazing into
~~heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes, and
~~said, ‘men of galilee, why do you stand looking into the heaven? this
~~jesus, who was taken up from you unto heaven.’”(acts 1:9-11) also: “…
~~for it is written, ‘he will give his angels charge of you,’ and ‘on
~~their hands they will bear you up…’” (matthew 4:5,6). additionally, this
~~is related in luke 4:10,11. did you not see how the old testament and
~~the new testament conveyed the following facts? 1. that whosoever is
~~hanged from a tree is accursed. 2. …that allâh safeguarded christ عليه
~~السلام and protected him from crucifixion. 3. …that christ said that the
~~disciples would be uncertain on the night of his betrayal. 4. that allâh
~~raised him to heaven. now, to you i raise this question: for what reason
~~is the cross considered as a holy object in christianity while
~~simultaneously being the place of christ’s عليه السلام torture – as you
~~believe? is it not the remembrance of an offense? is it not a symbol of
~~the crime and its instrument? furthermore, do you not see that the
~~crucifixion, as connected with christ عليه السلام has no historical or
~~religious basis to which it can be authentically attributed? why are you
~~so preoccupied with it to such an extent and why is so much importance
~~placed upon it within your belief? PageV01P0012
# if you remain content with these beliefs then honestly answer the
~~following questions: •… who is it that controlled the heavens and the
~~earth when their lord was tied to the wood of the cross? •… how
~~conceivable is it that for three days the universe could continue
~~without a god in control and maintaining its stability? •… who is it
~~that controls such enormous planets and subjects them as he so wills? •…
~~who is it that gives life and causes death and who uplifts or debases
~~whosoever he wills? • …who is it that provides sustenance to mankind and
~~livestock? • …how was the state of the whole universe when its “lord”
~~was in his grave? • …who caused his “death” and who then restored him to
~~life? • …how tremendously far above is allâh from what they maintain! 6.
~~christ died on the cross ‘…the belief that christ died on the cross in
~~order to rid and erase from humanity its inherited sins.’ this belief,
~~despite its illogicality and irrationality, contradicts the basic
~~fundament and major texts contained within the christians book. such are
~~as follows: 1. …progenitors are not killed in substitution of their
~~descendants. 2. everyone dies with his own sin. 3. the offending soul
~~dies. 4. …allâh accepts the repentance of those who sincerely repent.
~~the texts that support these fundamentals are: 1…. “the fathers shall
~~not be put to death for the children, nor shall the children be put to
~~death for the fathers.” (deuteronomy 24:16) PageV01P0013
# 2…. “in those days they shall no longer say: ‘the fathers have eaten
~~sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.’ but every one
~~shall die for his own sin; each man who eats sour grapes, his teeth
~~shall be set on edge.” (jeremiah 31:29,30) 3…. “yet you say, ‘why should
~~not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?’ when the son has
~~done what is lawful and right, and has been careful to observe all my
~~statutes, he shall surely live. the soul that sins shall die. the son
~~shall not suffer for the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the
~~righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall
~~be upon himself. but if a wicked man turns away from all his sins which
~~he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is lawful and
~~right, he shall surely live; he shall not die; none of the
~~transgressions which he has committed shall be remembered against him;
~~for the righteousness which he has done shall live.” (ezekiel 18:19-22)
~~7. the lord’s supper (the eucharist) in all that is related in the
~~gospels of matthew and mark on the story of the lord’s supper, there is
~~nothing that is joined with any command of christ عليه السلام that makes
~~this a continual act of worship or religious ritual. you can refer to
~~the story as related in these two gospels and you will find it as i have
~~stated. however, where paul relates that it should be taken as a
~~continual ritual, we find the additional statement: “and when he had
~~given thanks, he broke it, and said, ‘this is my body which is for you.
~~do this in remembrance of me.’” (i corinthians 11:24) PageV01P0014
# this is the root of christianity and its present reality, and this
~~reality – as you have seen – has no link to the messiah عليه السلام as
~~established by any verifiable chain. the only link is that it carries
~~the name of christ, whereas it fails the slightest historical or
~~religious investigation. indeed, the “holy book” of christianity
~~contains texts attributed to the messiah that contradict and refute the
~~basic beliefs and important principles on which the christian religion
~~is laid. the thinking person is one who disdains falsehood and hates
~~deceit. you should be intent on becoming one of those thinkers who have
~~renounced this profound state of affairs and who took every hardship and
~~difficulty in searching for the truth, demanding evidence with the
~~desire to get to the reality of the matter. so, i say: i shall stick to
~~what was mentioned in the christians book that will guide you if you
~~give thought to the truth and what is correct. do you not say in your
~~prayer: “hallowed be thy name. thy kingdom come…”[matthew 6:9,10]. are
~~you up to now waiting and saying: “thy kingdom come?” has that kingdom
~~not yet arrived? for if the kingdom has come and indeed been realized,
~~why do you still make this entreaty in your supplication? PageV01P0015
# the kingdom has surely come and reached its realization with the
~~arrival of the prophet whom the messiah عليه السلام himself informed us
~~of when he said: “but the counselor, the holy spirit, whom the father
~~will send in my name, he will teach you all good things, and bring to
~~your remembrance all that i have said to you.”(john 14:26) he also said:
~~“but when the counselor comes, whom i shall send you from the father, he
~~will bear witness to me.” (john 15:26). who is it to bear witness to the
~~message of the messiah عليه السلام and declare him free from what the
~~jews fabricate about him other than the information about the messenger
~~of allâh, muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم? christ also said: “i have yet
~~many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. when the spirit
~~of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will
~~declare to you the things that are to come. he will glorify me, for he
~~will take what is mine and declare it to you.” (john 16:12-14) muhammad
~~صلى الله عليه وسلم is indeed the paraclete (the comforter) to whom
~~christ عليه السلام pointed to. his message of muhammad صلى الله عليه
~~وسلم went forth. the idols fell beneath his feet (see isaiah 42:17) ,
~~and his message was general to all the earth. humanity found happiness
~~in him and thousands upon thousands believed in him and joined him from
~~among mankind. be one of them and achieve true happiness in this world
~~and in the hereafter. PageV01P0016
# so, how do you become one of those followers of muhammad صلى الله عليه
~~وسلم to achieve for yourself what his followers achieved? indeed, this
~~is a simple matter, all that you need to do is cleanse, purify, and rid
~~your body of all traces of things impure, and afterwards make the two
~~part declaration: أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله و أشهد أن محمدا رسول الله
~~ashhadu an la ilâha ill-allâh, wa ashhadu anna muhammadar rasulullah.”
~~know the requirements of that declaration, while understanding its
~~meaning – that there is nothing worthy of worship in truth except allâh,
~~and that he is alone in this right to be worshipped and obeyed, and that
~~he is the creator and sustainer. also that muhammad is the messenger of
~~allâh, and therefore follow and obey him in what he has ordered, and
~~believe in what he has informed us of. you must stay away from those
~~things which he forbade us from and rebuked us for. testify that jesus
~~was a servant of allâh, and the messenger and a word from him as
~~bestowed upon mary, and a spirit from him. also that paradise is a
~~reality as is hell, and that allâh will raise the dead from their
~~graves. if you make this a reality in your life then you will be
~~welcomed to become of those inheritors of the garden of paradise who are
~~with the prophets, the truthful ones, the martyrs, and the righteous.

# if you would like even more writings and references to point you
~~toward the truth and guide you to the straight path, for you is a list
~~of some of the books authored by some christian clergymen whom allâh has
~~guided to islam. they have written in these books why they moved from
~~christianity to islam along with the reasons that caused them to leave
~~christianity. they include those proofs and evidences by which they were
~~guided to know that islam is the final and everlasting message.
~~bibliography and references of books of some christians who accepted
~~islam. 1. religion and state by ali bin rabbin at-tabri. 2. …faithful
~~advice on exposing the reality of the religion of christianity by nasr

# this is the blessed group who has chosen truth over falsehood and
~~guidance over misguidance. do you consider yourself more knowledgeable
~~of christianity than them? then why have you not asked yourself about
~~the reasons that lead them to abandon their former religion and declare
~~their migration to islam? what are those proofs and arguments which they
~~read that drove them towards guidance and light? i say to you that this
~~blessed group is not the only one which left its religion and declared
~~its islam. they are indeed but a few of those learned christians who
~~have accepted islam. i have mentioned them to you just as an example.
~~there are many others like them and we witness caravans of faith in
~~their daily travels on their way towards islam, proclaiming that there
~~is no deity except allâh and muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is the
~~messenger of allâh. our final prayer is: all praises and thanks are to
~~allâh, the lord of all the worlds. PageV01P0019
